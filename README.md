## Data analysis for  Public bike sharing project dataset
### Data set used in these project: Ford gobike system Data
### Main Findings in expletory Data analysis
**1- We can note that is a lot of stations repeated in most station used as start station or distention station. It’s very good for availability of bikes for users but it make us asking what is the most station is have problem for availability of bike ? Or what is the most station used as start but very low as destination station? We may answer these question in Explanatory part<br><br>
2- From graphs there is a few numbers of female comparing to male so in explanatory analysis we need to study why there is a few number of them. Is the distance of their trips is too long to ride by bike or because there is no much bike available in start stations or most of them is not preferred to share bikes comparing to male user's or another reasons<br><br>
3- We can see there is a very low of user's have no problem in bike sharing compared to others that not prefer sharing we can ask here why? Is it because the long distance and the needed of speed to reduce the duration of trip or another reason<br><br>
4- We can see from graphs that the most of users prefer spend the least duration possible in trip and due of that the speed increase .I think we must make some advises in ride a bike with high speed .We can see also there is a low inverse relation between speed and age it's good for old people but still there is another people ride in high speed and it not good for their safety. The last thing we can note is there are very old people in 120 age is still ride a bike is really amazing. Something like that may use as advertisement or incentive to attractive more users to use bikes<br><br>
5- We can there is almost no difference between different genders in distance and speed but we can see the female and other are ride along distance but there is a few man ride very long distance like 14 and 16 km .In speed the female is the lowest in speed it may one of reasons that make female take more time in riding so that she not prefer riding a bike like men’s and we can see that also in distance graph<br><br>
6- In multi variant matrix graph We can see a few notes
1-speed is almost normal distributed
2-relation between speed and distance is also almost normal distributed
3-As expected the old age ride a short distance and in a short duration but there is some of them not care about speed and something like that is dangerous in their life<br><br>
7-In heat map graph we can note The strong relations here is between speed and duration as expected but the problem here is the relation between duration and distance is .5 and it support that the lot of user's is ride in high speed<br><br>**
### For explanatory part we choose to answer two main question:
**1-what is the most stations is have problem for availability of bike?<br>
2-Why there is a few number of female users?**
